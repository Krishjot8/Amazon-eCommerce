# Amazon-eCommerce

Hello Guys, I this is an eCommerce Application resembling the real Amazon website. I used Angular for the Front End, .NET Core for the Backend and SQL Server for the database for this project. As of now, this is not a fully working project and exactly not all the features are included right now, but this eCommerce application will look as close to the real appliation as time goes on.

To access the Backend for this project navigate to the master section to find the code. For the Frontend, go to the other branch.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
